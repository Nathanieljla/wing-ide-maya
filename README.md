Scripts and a menu for communicating between Maya and Wing

# Installation
NOTE: The included wing_installer will install pymel if it's not already installed.  It's recommended to start Maya with admin privileges while doing this install if you want pymel installed in Maya's site-packages instead of under window's userData.

### Drag & Drop

The easiest way to install this application is to ...
1. Click this File Link [wing_installer.py](https://github.com/Nathanieljla/wing-ide-maya/releases/download/v0.9.0/wing_installer.py) to download the installation python file.
2. Drag-n-drop the downloaded file into a maya-viewport. 
This will automatically install all the dependencies without requiring admin priviliges into your user-directory.
3. Hit 'Install'. Various shell windows might appear during the install.  This is normal.
